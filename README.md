### Hey!

I'm someone who is passionate about **GNU/Linux** and likes to **write code**.

<br>

Ever since I joined GitHub **12** years ago (the account is merged with old one's), I pushed **7908** commits, opened **1321** issues, submitted **867** pull requests, received **17305** stars across **45** personal projects, and contributed to **8** public repositories.

I'm in love with programming systems so I mostly write **Rust**, **C**, **C++**.

Also, I have projects that I wrote using **Go**, **Python**, **JS**, **Dart**.

I sometimes write blogs and wikis that you can check on my [website](https://msakg.com). Feel free to reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/msakg/) about **job-related** matters.

Ping me on `@msakg:matrix.org` if you want to chat!
